These are like middle-sized birds from the thick, jungle-y areas. 
You can spot them hanging out only in the warm, tropical parts of the Americas (except for that one time someone found a really old bird bone in Switzerland, but don't quote me on that). 
Their feathers are all soft and comfy, and they've got these long tails that they wag from side to side, like they're saying "hey" to everyone. 
Most of them, except the first two on the list, have these tail feathers that look like mini rackets because the middle part sticks out, kinda like they're ready to play some weird birdy sport
