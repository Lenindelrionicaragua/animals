The Central American agouti, affectionately known as the guaqueque in Chiapas, sereque in the Yucatán Peninsula, and cotuza in El Salvador, wears many regional names like a colorful badge. 
Hailing from the family Dasyproctidae, this charming critter goes by various monikers, such as guatín in Colombia, ñeque in Panama, jochi colorado, cherenga, and guatusa in Ecuador, and even sihuayro in Cuzco, Peru. 
But wait, there's more – you can call it carma, picure, or añuje too! With its official title being Dasyprocta punctata, this rodent is a captivating member of the agouti family.
Measuring between 42 and 62 cm and weighing a modest 2 to 3 kg, this agouti carries itself with a distinct reddish-brown fur that adds a touch of flair to its appearance. 
Its home range spans from the sun-kissed lands of southern Mexico through the lush landscapes of Central America, all the way down to the northern reaches of Argentina. 
Not content with sticking to terra firma, this delightful creature also ventured to Puerto Rico and Cuba, courtesy of human introductions.
Finding solace beneath the verdant canopy, the agouti is a true forest dweller, typically making its home at altitudes below 2,000 meters. 
As a resident of the wild, its status according to the IUCN is one of least concern, a testament to its adaptability and widespread presence.
