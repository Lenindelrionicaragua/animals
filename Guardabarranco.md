They are medium-sized birds of the dense jungles. They are found only in the tropical zone of the American continent (although a fossil has been discovered in Switzerland). 
These birds have soft plumage and a long tail, which they move from side to side. In all species except the first two in the list below, 
the central tail feathers (which are the longest) have a portion of the shaft bare, so they resemble a racket.
