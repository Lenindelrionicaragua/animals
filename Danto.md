The tapir is the largest terrestrial mammal in our country. 
It measures two meters long and one meter high, and can weigh over 450 pounds. 
It feeds on grass, fruits, and occasionally invertebrates. 
It has solitary habits, and a specific reproductive season is not known. 
They have a gestation period of over a year, and only one offspring is born. 
The young are distinct, with white spots as seen in the illustration. It's a highly endangered animal due to deforestation, nearly extinct.
